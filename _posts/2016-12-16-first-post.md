Themes

Jekyll has an extensive theme system, which allows you to leverage community-maintained templates and styles to customize your site’s presentation. Jekyll themes package layouts, includes, and stylesheets in a way that can be overridden by your site’s content.



Installing a themePermalink

To install a theme, first, add the theme to your site’s Gemfile:

 gem 'my-awesome-jekyll-theme'
 Save the changes to your Gemfile
 Run the command bundle install to install the theme
 Finally, activate the theme by adding the following to your site’s _config.yml:

  theme: my-awesome-jekyll-theme
